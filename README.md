## Fork your TA’s GitHub repo to get started. Submit your solutions via a pull request on GitHub by the beginning of tutorial on Friday.
1. Write a function that returns the odd (1, 3, 5, etc.) rows of any dataframe passed as an argument.
2. Repeat a subset of last week’s exercise, but write functions to accomplish these tasks.
	• return the number of observations for a given species included in the data set
	• return a dataframe for flowers with Sepal.Width greater than a value specified by the function user • write the data for a given species to a comma-delimited file with the given species name as the file name

## Turning in your assignment via GitHub
Once you have committed all changes to your local Git repos and pushed all of those commits to the forked repo on GitHub, you can “turn in” your assignment using a pull request. This can be done from the GitHub repo website. When viewing the forked repo, select “Pull requests” in the upper middle of the screen, then click the green “New pull request” button in the upper right. You’ll then see a screen with a history of commits for you and your collaborator, select the green “Create pull request button”. In the text box next to your user icon near the top of the page, remove whatever text is there and add your last name. Then click the green “Create pull request” button.
